## Overview

### The challenge

A design featuring four cards have been given. We have to code the website in such a way so that users are able to view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React


### What I learned

The biggest thing I learned from this project is that we cannot just give the URL of a local image and expect it to show up in React. We will have to import the image as follows:

```js
import image from "./images/image.jpg";
```

Only then will the image show up and not give any errors.

I also learned about CSS transitions and the Grid layout.
